An Website to Buying and selling Second Hand Truck . It helps whoever is struggling to sell his/her old truck and whoever wants to own a second hand truck at a cheap Price.Actually this website creates a bridge between buyers and sellers and they will be mutually helped by each other. I have a lot of truck owner feels very helpless to selling their own old trucks/vehicle, on the other hand many small companies and novice entrepreneur wants to start his business with small capital , so i thought this project will be very helpful for both of them , it will connect them and will influence to help each other. It is now in operation . If the demand of this website gets higher day by day I will try to enlarge the scale of this website.
